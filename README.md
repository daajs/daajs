DAAJS
=========

DAAJS is a class-oriented event-driven JavaScript framework to be used as a powerful programming
environment for a variety of projects, starting from simple websites that require minimal
dynamics - up to complex applications that require a wide range of interactive capabilities.

DAAJS was designed with desktop applications in mind, but desktop applications of the next
generation: opened, tunable, reconfigurable on-the-fly and with the whole Net at hand. So it is
natively suitable for mobile applications, for example. But the rest of the web is also drawing
now from simple interactivity closer and closer to complex functionality. And DAAJS is mostly
for very complex functionality that requires high levels of abstraction to be implemented and
implemented in easily maintainable and scalable ways.

DAAJS, in brief, is to compose UI of ready-to-use components and to concentrate on bisuness
logic. It is supposed to be a real RAD tool.
